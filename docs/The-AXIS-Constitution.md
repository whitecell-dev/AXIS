# **AXIS Constitution v0.1**

*Foundational Protocol for Verifiable State Transformations*

---

## **1. Purpose**

AXIS defines a universal model of computation based on **verifiable state transformations**.
It establishes conventions for declaring, executing, and auditing transformations using a minimal set of primitives.

AXIS is not a product or framework.
It is a **standard**: a constitutional layer for deterministic, auditable computation.

---

## **2. Core Model**

AXIS execution is modeled as:

```
JSON → α-conversion (Pipes) → β-reduction (Rules) → Side Effects (Adapters)
```

* **Input:** JSON state
* **Process:** Transformation pipelines defined in YAML
* **Output:** JSON state with cryptographic audit trail

The atomic unit of AXIS is the **Verifiable State Transformation (VST)**:
a pure function applied to state, producing new state with reproducible proof.

---

## **3. Design Principles**

### 3.1 Determinism

* Canonicalize all inputs before processing.
* No non-finite values (`NaN`, `Infinity`).
* Consistent key ordering and cross-platform reproducibility.

### 3.2 Purity & Separation

* **Pipes:** Data normalization, no side effects.
* **Rules:** Pure logic transformations, no side effects.
* **Adapters:** Controlled side effects, fully audited.

### 3.3 Trust & Auditability

* Every transformation is content-addressed (`SHA3-256`).
* Input/output hashes must be logged at each stage.
* Conflicts and errors must be accumulated, not hidden.

---

## **4. Configuration Standards**

### 4.1 Pipes (α-conversion)

```yaml
pipeline:
  - rename: {old_field: new_field}
  - validate: {field: "type"}
  - enrich: {field: "value"}
  - transform: {field: "{{template}}"}
  - extract: {new_key: "path"}
  - filter: {field: {gt: 100}}
```

Rules:

* Deterministic only.
* Use `now()` or `timestamp()` for temporal enrichment.
* Avoid defaults that Rules will override.

---

### 4.2 Rules (β-reduction)

```yaml
component: ComponentName
rules:
  - if: "condition"
    priority: 10
    then: {field: value}
    else: {field: other}
```

Rules:

* Conditions parsed into restricted AST (no arbitrary eval).
* Priorities resolve conflicts; higher priority wins.
* Use `field+: [item]` for additive list operations.
* Conflict attempts must be logged in structured `errors[]`.

---

### 4.3 Adapters (Side Effects)

```yaml
adapters:
  - name: descriptive_name
    command: unix_command
    args: ["--flag", "{{template}}"]
    input: "{{stdin_template}}"
```

Rules:

* Adapters must run in **dry-run mode by default**; execution requires explicit `--exec`.
* File paths must be sandboxed under a declared root.
* Idempotence: identical adapter runs must be skipped unless `--force`.
* Audit-first, execute-second: intent is always logged before execution.

---

## **5. Security Requirements**

* No `eval()` or dynamic code execution.
* All conditions whitelisted in AST parser.
* File operations restricted to safe directories.
* All subprocesses limited by timeout (30s default).
* All adapter outputs must be captured and logged.

---

## **6. Error & Conflict Handling**

* Errors accumulate into an `errors[]` array; system must not fail silently.
* Conflicts resolved by priority. If equal, first-writer wins, later attempts are logged.
* Example structured conflict:

  ```json
  {"field": "status", "old": "active", "new": "verified_admin", "rule": 7, "priority": 0}
  ```

---

## **7. Audit Trails**

Every transformation appends `_audit` metadata:

* **Pipes:** `{pipeline_hash, input_hash, output_hash}`
* **Rules:** `{rules_hash, input_hash, output_hash, conflicts, iterations}`
* **Adapters:** `{config_hash, input_hash, execution_log}`

Audit trails must be immutable and reproducible.

---

## **8. Testing & Validation**

* Golden vectors: canonical input/output pairs for regression.
* Deterministic tests: fixed timestamps, canonical ordering.
* Edge cases: nulls, empty datasets, large numbers, Unicode.
* Conflict tests: deliberate overlapping rules to validate logging.

---

## **9. Scaling Path**

AXIS is the **reference implementation** of the Verifiable State Transformation.

* **AXIS (Now):** JSON-native shell, YAML conventions, auditable transformations.
* **KERN (Next):** Compiled execution (WASM/native) for speed & portability.
* **MNEME (Future):** Distributed, content-addressable memory for state histories.

---

## **10. Constitutional Clause**

AXIS must remain:

* **Minimal** (no unnecessary primitives).
* **Deterministic** (same input → same output).
* **Auditable** (all transformations logged & hashed).
* **Composable** (pipelines must chain cleanly in the Unix spirit).

Any extension (e.g., KERN, MNEME) must respect these invariants.

AXIS is not a product; it is a **constitutional protocol for computation.**
