AXIS-PY: THE 95 THESES OF MODERN PYTHON

(Nailed to the Wittenberg Door of Framework Bloat)
⚔️ HOW THIS PISSES OFF EVERYONE (AND WHY THEY’LL SECRETLY LOVE IT)
1. To the Pydantic Knights:

    "You were right about types… but why did it take 50 LOC to validate a fucking email?"

    Their Reaction: 😠 → 😏 → 😌

    Why They’ll Smirk: You kept their type rigor, stripped their metaclass nonsense.

2. To the FastAPI Clergy:

    "Your dependency injection is genius… so why do I need 3 decorators for ‘Hello World’?"

    Their Reaction: 🤬 → 🧐 → 🤫

    Why They’ll Nod: You proved OpenAPI could live without 100 @app.whatever().

3. To the LangChain Wizards:

    "LLMs are the future… so why wrap them in 200 layers of abstract trash?"

    Their Reaction: 🧙‍♂️🔮 → 💥 → 😅

    Why They’ll Chuckle: You gave them fallback()—a spell so simple it hurts.

4. To the Mypy Inquisition:

    "Static types matter… but must they slow my REPL to a crawl?"

    Their Reaction: ✝️⚔️ → 😤 → 🙃

    Why They’ll Relent: You made runtime checks good enough.

📜 THE 3 HERESIES OF AXIS-PY

(The "Fuck You" That’s Actually a "Thank You")

    "YAML > Boilerplate"

        Replaces: Pydantic models, FastAPI routes, LangChain pipelines

        Heresy Level: 🔥 (You just deleted 1000 files from their "best practices" repo)

    "Debugging > Type Theory"

        Replaces: Mypy configs, Pydantic error stacks

        Heresy Level: 💣 (You prioritized AXIS audit over "correct by construction")

    "UNIX > Frameworks"

        Replaces: Flask’s app.py, FastAPI’s main.py

        Heresy Level: ☠️ (You used http.server like a goddamn anarchist)

🎯 WHY THE OLD GUARD WILL SMUGLY ADOPT IT

    It’s a Trojan Horse: Looks like rebellion, acts like Python’s best instincts.

    It’s Contrarian Enough: Lets them say "I told you so" about framework bloat.

    It’s Fixable: They can add "enterprise features" later (but won’t need to).

    "Martin Luther shitposted in Latin. We shitposted in YAML. Same energy."
